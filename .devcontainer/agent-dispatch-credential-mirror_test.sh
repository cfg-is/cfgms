#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Tests for agent-dispatch.sh's credential mirror (T6).
#
# There is no existing test file for agent-dispatch.sh -- this is the first
# one, and it covers only the mirror.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED. Containers used to bind-mount the host's live
# ~/.claude/.credentials.json as a FILE. The host rotates its token by writing
# a replacement and renaming it into place, and a file bind mount pins the
# ORIGINAL inode -- so a running container never saw the replacement and kept
# presenting a credential that had been revoked. Measured on one sweep:
# container up 17:45:43, host rewrote the credential 18:13:39, next request
# rejected 18:14:15 with "OAuth access token has been revoked".
#
# Four of the six mount sites were additionally read-WRITE, which let a
# container write the host's live credential.
#
# HERMETIC, and deliberately so. Nothing here runs docker, and nothing here
# reads or writes the real ~/.claude. Both the source and the mirror are
# redirected at temp directories via CFGMS_HOST_CREDS_FILE and
# CFGMS_CREDS_MIRROR_DIR. A test that touched the live credential could
# revoke the token this very session is authenticated with.
#
# NO SUBSHELLS AROUND TEST BLOCKS. An earlier draft of this file wrapped each
# block in `( ... ) || true`; a subshell gets its own copy of the counters, so
# the suite printed two failing assertions and then `Summary: 0/0 passed` and
# exited 0. A test file that cannot fail is worse than no test file, because
# it occupies the place where a real one would go.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT TEST, stated rather than implied: none of these observes a
# real OAuth rotation against a live container. Whether a RUNNING Claude Code
# re-reads the credential file at all, or only reads it at process start, is
# unresolved -- it cannot be settled from the minified CLI bundle, and the
# decisive test needs a real rotation, which must not be forced because
# forcing one revokes the host session's own token. If the CLI only reads at
# start, the mirror reduces the FREQUENCY of an in-flight auth failure rather
# than eliminating it. That residual risk is a documented caveat here, not a
# fabricated assertion.
#
# Follows the hermetic pattern of investigator-entrypoint_test.sh.
