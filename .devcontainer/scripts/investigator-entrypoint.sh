# investigator-entrypoint.sh — runs inside a headless cfg-agent container
# launched by `agent-dispatch.sh launch-investigator` (Issue #3903). Mounted
# into the container at runtime by the launcher; not baked into
# cfg-agent:latest, so changes here don't require an image rebuild — the same
# not-baked-in pattern review-entrypoint.sh documents in its own header.
#
# Selects one of two modes from the single CLI arg the launcher passes:
#
#   plan       — the metadata-only planner (story S4). Execs `claude -p`
#                against the prompt the caller wrote to
#                /workspace-out/.investigator-plan-prompt.md, with the
#                --disallowedTools list below as defense-in-depth.
#   <lane-id>  — a finder lane (stories S6/S7/S8). Execs that lane's own
#                Python entrypoint, mounted read-only by the launcher's
#                --lane-entrypoint flag. This script carries no lane-specific
#                logic of its own — it only dispatches to that script.
#
# Never calls `gh`, `git commit`, `git push`, or `git branch`, and never
# writes outside /workspace-out. /workspace (the repository checkout) is
# bind-mounted read-only by the launcher, so any write attempt fails with
# EROFS regardless — this script adds no code path that could bypass that,
# and deliberately does not source setup-env.sh, which would otherwise
# configure a git identity (`git config --global user.name/user.email`) this
# profile must never have, and rewrite files under /workspace in place.
