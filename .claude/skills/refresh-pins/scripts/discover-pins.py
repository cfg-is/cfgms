"""Discover all pinned dependencies across the CFGMS repo.

Emits a JSON inventory to stdout following the schema documented in
references/inventory-schema.md. Each pin entry includes every file:line
location where the version string appears, so consumers can verify
lockstep bumps.

Discovery sources:
- go.mod              — Go toolchain directive
- .github/workflows/  — GO_VERSION env vars, go-version: in setup-go uses, and
  `docker pull` / `pull_with_retry` pre-pull steps that warm a golang: base
  image ahead of the build — these must move in lockstep with the Dockerfile
  FROM line below but live in a workflow step, not a Dockerfile.
- **/Dockerfile*      — FROM golang:X tags (toolchain, lockstep) and every other
  base image (alpine, debian, ...) as its own `kind: "docker"` pin. Globbed from
  the repo root, not from cmd/ and .devcontainer/ only: Dockerfile.test-runner
  sits at the root and was invisible to the earlier globs, so a toolchain bump
  left the image that runs the integration suites on the old Go version.
- **/*.ps1            — every PowerShell script in the repo (windows-setup.ps1
  today). Tool-pin version strings are grepped here the same as the other
  install-surface files; a matched `Url = '...'` line also pulls in its
  paired `Sha256 = '...'` line, which carries no version string of its own to
  grep for. Claude Code CLI is NOT grepped here — it is exempt from pin
  tracking entirely (founder decision 2026-10-01, Issue #4473; see
  references/cooldown-policy.md "Claude Code CLI exemption").
- .github/ci-images.yml — every third-party image CI pulls from Docker Hub
  (compose test services, Dockerfile FROM bases, workflow pre-pulls), each
  digest-pinned with a ghcr.io mirror name. Non-golang entries are emitted as
  `kind: "docker"` pins carrying `upstream_ref` and `mirror_name`; golang:
  entries join the go-toolchain lockstep `locations[]` instead.
- go.mod require blocks — every DIRECT module requirement, `kind: "gomod"`.
  Indirect requirements are deliberately not enumerated (334 of them here);
  their versions are chosen by MVS rather than by us, so the actionable signal
  is a CVE, not staleness. SKILL.md Phase 2 covers the full transitive graph
  with a single vulnerability scan instead.
- web/package.json — direct dependencies and devDependencies, `kind: "npm"`.
- .github/workflows/dependency-pin-check.yml — the existing tool pin list
  (check_version <name> <repo> <version> calls)
- .github/workflows/*.yml — GitHub Action SHA pins (uses: <owner>/<name>@<sha>)
  — one inventory entry per unique (action, sha) tuple so SHA drift across
  workflows is naturally visible (multiple entries with the same action name
  but different SHAs).
- .mcp.json — git-pinned MCP servers (git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>@<tag>,
  e.g. serena). kind="mcp"; these are agent *tooling* dependencies whose tool
  names are consumed by name in .claude/agents/*.md, so a tool-renaming release
  is a breaking change (see references/decision-matrix.md "MCP server pins").

# CLI is exempt from pin tracking entirely (founder decision 2026-10-01,
# Issue #4473; see references/cooldown-policy.md "Claude Code CLI
# exemption") — .devcontainer/Dockerfile and windows-setup.ps1 both resolve
# npm's `stable` dist-tag at build/setup time instead of naming a version, so
# there is no version string left for a discoverer to find or a bump story to
# target. A prior version of this script had a discoverer for `ARG
# CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` in .devcontainer/Dockerfile; that ARG no longer
# exists, having been replaced by the unrelated `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION_OVERRIDE`
# build-arg, which pins one exact release rather than declaring the tracked
# version and is itself out of scope for pin discovery.

#:   Sha256 = '6ce9a957...'
#: A literal version-string grep matches the Url line but can never match the
#: Sha256 line next to it, so without pairing the hash silently falls out of
#: lockstep tracking whenever the version bumps — the gap issue #4472 reported
#: for trufflehog.
