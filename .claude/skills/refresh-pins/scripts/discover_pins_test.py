"""Coverage tests for discover-pins.py.

The discovery script had no tests, and every gap in it has cost real work:
a repo-root Dockerfile invisible to the toolchain pin (which would have left
the integration-test runner image on an old Go version), and container base
images absent from the inventory entirely while the shipped controller and
steward images are built FROM them.

These tests assert the *shape* of coverage against a synthetic repo, so a
future refactor cannot silently narrow discovery again.

Run: python3 .claude/skills/refresh-pins/scripts/discover_pins_test.py

    This is the regression guard issue #4472 asked for: a `git grep` for a
    pin's current version string must find no tracked location outside what
    discover-pins.py reports, comments and docs excepted. Docs are excepted
    structurally — docs/ and markdown reference files are never part of the
    install/config-surface universe searched here, matching how
    inventory-schema.md already scopes these pin kinds. Comments
    (`#`-prefixed lines) are excepted explicitly, since a rationale note or a
    commented-out example referencing a version is not a location that needs
    to move in lockstep.

    Scope: go-toolchain, every dependency-pin-check.yml tool pin, and
    claude-code-cli — the pins whose locations[] comes from grepping a literal
    version string across a fixed file set, built by discover_go_toolchain(),
    discover_tool_pins() and discover_claude_code_cli(). Only this class
    carries a "missed occurrence" risk: the grep's file-class universe can
    silently fall out of step with where the string actually appears, which is
    exactly the #4472 bug (windows-setup.ps1 and a workflow pre-pull line
    weren't in the search set at all). Every other kind (gomod, npm, docker,
    GitHub Action SHA, mcp) is parsed structurally from the one file that
    declares it — there is nowhere else a location could hide.

    Runs against the real repo (not the synthetic one above) because the
    whole point is to catch a real location discovery doesn't yet know about.
