"""Deterministic step partitioner for the security review harness (Issue #4056).

Before this story, the planner model decided BOTH how to cut the bundle into
review steps AND what to investigate in each one. Only the second is the
model's real contribution: the first varies so much between models that two
plans become impossible to compare (see the issue's evidence sweep), which
blocks benchmarking one planner model against another. This module replaces
the first job with plain code: `partition(bundle_dir)` is a pure function of
the bundle's `01-tree.tsv` file inventory plus `06-config-surface.tsv`'s
`referencing_files` column (Issue #4056 AC4b) -- no model, no I/O beyond
reading those two already-written bundle artifacts, no randomness. The same
bundle produces a byte-identical, order-independent partition every time
(AC1) -- `planner.py::prepare()` writes the result to `plan/partition.json`
(AC10) and `planner.py::build_prompt()` presents each returned step's own
`scope`/`files` to the planner model, which is asked only for hypotheses
(AC6).

Two axes, concatenated in the list `partition()` returns:

- **`axis: "directory"`** (AC2). Files group by directory: the same top-level-
  subtree boundary `planner.py::validate_step()`'s `BOUNDED_SCOPE_RULE`
  already enforces, computed independently here (`_directory_boundary()`)
  rather than imported from `planner.py`, since `planner.py` imports this
  module to compute the partition and a reverse import would cycle. A
  directory-axis step therefore satisfies `BOUNDED_SCOPE_RULE` BY
  CONSTRUCTION: it is never possible for one to span two top-level subtrees,
  so `validate_step()` never has to catch one that does.
- **`axis: "boundary"`** (AC4). Cut by trust boundary rather than by the tree:
  for every configuration key in `06-config-surface.tsv` whose
  `referencing_files` (AC4b) span more than one top-level subtree, one step
  containing exactly those files -- deliberately spanning the same subtree
  boundary the directory axis cannot cross, so a defect whose evidence sits on
  both sides of a package boundary (a caller that assumes the callee
  validates; a callee that assumes the caller did) has somewhere to be seen.
  A key referenced from only one subtree is not a boundary case -- the
  directory axis already covers it -- and produces no boundary step (AC4c: an
  empty boundary axis is a valid outcome, never a failure).

Both axes are bounded the same way: no step's total `loc` over its
`tier != "test"` files exceeds `MAX_STEP_NON_TEST_LOC` (AC3). A `tier: test`
file still travels with its subject (evidence about intended behaviour) --
it just never counts against the budget. An oversized group of either axis
splits deterministically (`_split_by_loc_budget()`), sorted by a
same-subject-stays-together key so a Go file and its `_test.go` sibling land
in the same bucket, then by path -- so the split itself is as reproducible as
everything else this module computes.

Every step's `step_id` is a digest of its own sorted scope path list (AC5) --
never a counter -- so two independent partitioner runs over the same commit
(two different planner models, or the same model months apart) produce
identical ids for identical scopes, the "shared spine" `plan/partition.json`
exists to give two planners' contributions something to be diffed against.

**Purity and safety.** Like `metadata.py`, this module's only I/O is reading
two files already written under `bundle_dir` -- no subprocess, no network, no
model call. Every path is re-checked against `metadata._prompt_safe()` before
it can become part of a returned step (mirroring `planner.py`'s own
`_read_bundle_tree_paths()` re-check), so a hand-crafted or corrupted bundle
row cannot smuggle a control character into a step that a prompt later
renders.
