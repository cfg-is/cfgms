"""Deterministic step partitioner for the security review harness (Issue #4056).

Before this story, the planner model decided BOTH how to cut the bundle into
review steps AND what to investigate in each one. Only the second is the
model's real contribution: the first varies so much between models that two
plans become impossible to compare (see the issue's evidence sweep), which
blocks benchmarking one planner model against another. This module replaces
the first job with plain code: `partition(bundle_dir)` is a pure function of
the bundle's `01-tree.tsv` file inventory plus `06-config-surface.tsv`'s and
`07-authz-store-surface.tsv`'s `referencing_files` columns (Issue #4056 AC4b;
`07-authz-store-surface.tsv` added by Issue #4060) -- no model, no I/O beyond
reading those already-written bundle artifacts, no randomness. The same
bundle produces a byte-identical, order-independent partition every time
(AC1) -- `planner.py::prepare()` writes the result to `plan/partition.json`
(AC10) and `planner.py::build_prompt()` presents each returned step's own
`scope`/`files` to the planner model, which is asked only for hypotheses
(AC6).

Three axes, concatenated in the list `partition()` returns:

- **`axis: "directory"`** (AC2). Files group by directory: the same top-level-
  subtree boundary `planner.py::validate_step()`'s `BOUNDED_SCOPE_RULE`
  already enforces, computed independently here (`_directory_boundary()`)
  rather than imported from `planner.py`, since `planner.py` imports this
  module to compute the partition and a reverse import would cycle. A
  directory-axis step therefore satisfies `BOUNDED_SCOPE_RULE` BY
  CONSTRUCTION: it is never possible for one to span two top-level subtrees,
  so `validate_step()` never has to catch one that does.
- **`axis: "boundary"`** (AC4). Cut by trust boundary rather than by the tree,
  fed by two independent bundle artifacts that share one row shape:
  - For every configuration key in `06-config-surface.tsv` whose
    `referencing_files` (AC4b) span more than one top-level subtree, one step
    containing exactly those files -- deliberately spanning the same subtree
    boundary the directory axis cannot cross, so a defect whose evidence sits
    on both sides of a package boundary (a caller that assumes the callee
    validates; a callee that assumes the caller did) has somewhere to be
    seen. A key referenced from only one subtree is not a boundary case --
    the directory axis already covers it -- and produces no boundary step
    (AC4c: an empty boundary axis is a valid outcome, never a failure).
  - `07-authz-store-surface.tsv` (Issue #4060) carries the same shape for the
    **authorization** boundary: the package that declares the RBAC store
    interfaces and decides with them, joined with the package(s) that
    implement the specific methods that decision reads a grant through (the
    "grant read path"). It targets the fail-open risk a data-driven RBAC
    model actually has -- not a route naming the wrong permission string
    (verified unanswerable: `features/rbac/engine.go`'s
    `AuthEngine.CheckPermission` resolves each request's resource/action
    against runtime grants, so no route-keyed join ever leaves
    `features/controller/api/`), but a single over-broad grant row being
    accepted by a loose `permissionMatches` comparison once the
    role/subject/assignment reads it depends on have actually returned data.
    Seeing the matcher (`features/rbac`) and the store that feeds it
    (`pkg/storage/providers/*`) in one step is what makes that visible; a
    directory-scoped step never would. See
    `metadata._extract_authz_store_surface()` for exactly how the join is
    computed, and its module docstring for why the row-naming and
    permission-string alternatives were rejected. An empty authorization axis
    (no interface declared in scope, or no external package implements the
    full read set) is a valid outcome for the same reason an empty
    configuration-keyed boundary axis is.
  Both feed the same `_boundary_steps()` unmodified: a row is a row,
  regardless of which artifact it came from.
- **`axis: "risk"`** (Issue #4066). Issue #4056 claimed G-3's coverage half
  (a `HIGH_RISK_TIERS` file appearing in at least two steps) was satisfied by
  construction by the two axes above. It is not: the directory axis gives
  every file exactly one step, and the boundary axis only reaches a file that
  happens to reference a configuration key (or, since #4060, sit in the
  authorization grant-read join) whose referencing files cross a subtree --
  most `entrypoint`/`security` files reference no such key at all. Measured
  on this repository's own tree: 252 `entrypoint`/`security`-tier files
  exist; at most 12 sit under the #4060 authorization axis's two scope
  directories (`features/rbac/`, `pkg/storage/providers/`), and that axis
  fires only when a store interface is actually declared and implemented
  across them, so the real count is lower still. The scenario axis (#4059)
  is a separate, not-yet-merged effort. This axis closes the gap directly
  rather than stretching either existing one to fit data it does not
  naturally have: every row whose `tier` is in `HIGH_RISK_TIERS` (mirroring
  `planner.HIGH_RISK_TIERS`) is grouped -- across the whole reviewed tree,
  never by directory or configuration key.

  The first cut of this axis (round-robin interleave, then pack by budget,
  nothing else) does not hold up under directory skew: once round-robin
  exhausts every minority directory, every later bucket is built entirely
  from consecutive rows of whichever directory has the most high-risk files,
  which is exactly the directory axis's own grouping wearing a different
  `axis` label -- a file "reviewed twice" that way was actually reviewed
  once, from the same angle, and G-3 would report coverage that is not
  there. A PO fix round (Issue #4066, post-merge) measured this directly: a
  40/1/1 file split across three directories produced 5 of 6 risk steps
  confined to the dominant directory, and a sweep of 1-14 minority
  directories against 8-79 dominant-directory files found 144 configurations
  where a risk step's file set was set-identical to a directory-axis step's.
  `_pack_multi_directory()` (not plain `_pack_by_loc_budget()`) closes this:
  it tracks which directory boundaries (`_directory_boundary()`, the same
  granularity the directory axis itself groups by -- not the finer per-
  directory `_stem_key()` grouping `_interleave_by_directory()` uses only to
  order rows within a boundary) a bucket has accumulated so far, and while a
  bucket holds rows from only one boundary it reserves enough headroom
  (`MAX_STEP_NON_TEST_LOC` minus the smallest-`loc` row that belongs to a
  different boundary) so that, if the bucket would otherwise close
  single-boundary, it can still append that borrowed row and stay in
  budget -- guaranteeing every bucket spans more than one directory boundary
  whenever the high-risk row set itself does, not just the buckets
  round-robin happens to interleave before minorities run out. A borrowed
  row costs its full `loc` like any other row, and the borrow is declined
  outright when it would not fit: `planner.py::validate_step()` measures a
  step's budget over every non-test path in its scope with no exemption for
  a second appearance, so an uncounted borrow does not buy a bigger step --
  it gets the whole step rejected and deleted (PR #4068 review finding; see
  `_pack_multi_directory()` for the measured numbers). Because a
  multi-boundary bucket is, by construction, impossible to set-equal a
  directory-axis step (the latter is always confined to one boundary), every
  bucket that does borrow is a look G-3 has not already had.

  Two bundles bound that: one whose high-risk files all sit in a single
  directory boundary (no other boundary exists to borrow from -- and, not
  coincidentally, the directory axis's own step is already the full set, so
  nothing is lost by comparison), and one where the budget leaves no room for
  even the smallest foreign row. In the second, the bucket closes
  single-boundary rather than over budget: an over-budget step is not a
  weaker look at a file, it is no look at all. An empty risk axis (no
  `HIGH_RISK_TIERS` file in scope) is a valid outcome, same as an empty
  boundary axis.

All three axes are bounded the same way: no step's total `loc` over its
counted `tier != "test"` files exceeds `MAX_STEP_NON_TEST_LOC` (AC3). A
`tier: test` file still travels with its subject (evidence about intended
behaviour) -- it just never counts against the budget. That single
exemption (`_counted_loc()`) is the whole of it, and it is the same one
`planner.py::validate_step()` applies when it re-measures a step: this
module never packs against a budget its own validator computes
differently. An oversized
directory or boundary group splits deterministically
(`_split_by_loc_budget()`), sorted by a same-subject-stays-together key so a
Go file and its `_test.go` sibling land in the same bucket, then by path --
so the split itself is as reproducible as everything else this module
computes. The risk axis reuses `_split_by_loc_budget()`'s packing primitive
(`_pack_by_loc_budget()`, factored out for exactly this reuse) for the
single-directory case, where no borrowing is possible or needed, and
`_pack_multi_directory()` otherwise -- both feed the packer a
directory-interleaved order instead of the same-subject-first sort, per the
risk axis's own note above -- packing risk-tier rows in directory order would
silently reproduce the directory axis's own grouping.

Every step's `step_id` is a digest of its own sorted scope path list (AC5) --
never a counter -- so two independent partitioner runs over the same commit
(two different planner models, or the same model months apart) produce
identical ids for identical scopes, the "shared spine" `plan/partition.json`
exists to give two planners' contributions something to be diffed against.

**Purity and safety.** Like `metadata.py`, this module's only I/O is reading
files already written under `bundle_dir` -- no subprocess, no network, no
model call. Every path is re-checked against `metadata._prompt_safe()` before
it can become part of a returned step (mirroring `planner.py`'s own
`_read_bundle_tree_paths()` re-check), so a hand-crafted or corrupted bundle
row cannot smuggle a control character into a step that a prompt later
renders.

    `loc` among rows belonging to a *different* boundary -- so that if the
    bucket would otherwise close single-boundary, the smallest such row can
    still be borrowed in without breaking the budget. Once a bucket naturally
    gains a second boundary, the reservation is dropped for the rest of that
    bucket -- the guarantee this bucket exists to provide is already met.

    **A borrowed row costs its full `loc`, exactly like any other row** (PR
    #4068 review finding). It is a second appearance of a file already read in
    its own bucket, so exempting it from this bucket's budget is defensible in
    principle -- but `planner.py::validate_step()` grants no such exemption:
    it sums `tree_index[p]["loc"]` over every non-test path in a step's scope,
    borrowed or not, and rejects the step above `MAX_STEP_NON_TEST_LOC`. A
    rejected step is deleted from the plan, so an uncounted borrow did not buy
    a bigger step -- it silently deleted the whole step, reverting the risk
    axis to the single-boundary shape it exists to fix, with no coverage
    signal. Measured on this repository's real numbers before the fix: 12
    300-`loc` `security` rows in `pkg/cert` plus `cmd/steward/main.go` at its
    real 2209 `loc` produced four risk steps of 2509/3709/3709/2809 counted
    `loc` -- every one of them rejected by `validate_step()`. The packer's
    budget and the validator's budget must be the same number (`_counted_loc()`),
    so the borrow is declined whenever it would not fit.

    Two cases therefore close single-boundary, and both are deliberate:
    a bucket whose rows already fill the budget so tightly that even the
    smallest foreign row would push it over, and the degenerate bucket whose
    lone row is itself at or over the whole budget (`_pack_by_loc_budget()`'s
    long-standing accepted exception -- a file cannot be split). Staying in
    budget wins over the multi-boundary guarantee in that conflict: a
    single-boundary step is a weaker look at a file, while an over-budget step
    is no look at all.

    The reservation is itself dropped whenever it could not pay for itself --
    when no row of the boundary being packed is small enough to fit inside
    `MAX_STEP_NON_TEST_LOC` minus the borrow, every bucket would close with
    one row, overflow the reservation anyway, and STILL have the borrow
    declined by the budget test above. That trades whole steps for nothing:
    a 1400-`loc` foreign row against 300-`loc` rows fragmented three
    budget-filling steps into twelve single-row ones, none of which gained a
    second boundary. Falling back to the full budget keeps the steps whole and
    loses nothing that was ever reachable.
