"""Finding and step-envelope schema validation for the security review harness.

Three shapes are validated here:

- A **finding** (`validate_finding`): the structured output a lane emits per
  vulnerability, matching the epic's "Finding schema" exactly. The
  de-duplication key is `file` + `symbol` + `vuln_class` — never a line
  number, because line ranges rot as `develop` advances while symbol names
  survive. This module does not define or read a line-number field; a caller
  that includes one gets it silently ignored, not rejected and not validated,
  so nothing downstream can key on it by accident.

- A **step envelope** (`validate_step_envelope`): the record a lane writes per
  step regardless of outcome (SEC3900 finding B7). `state` resolves to one of
  the four terminal states (see docs/architecture/security-review-harness.md);
  `state == "complete"` additionally requires a `findings` array (which may be
  empty — a genuinely clean step is a valid, distinct case from
  `refused`/`failed`), and every other state requires a non-empty
  `stop_reason_raw` recording the provider's raw, unmodified terminating
  reason so a new refusal encoding after a provider update is diagnosable
  from the recorded envelope rather than lost to a normalized enum.
  `files_intended`/`files_read` are optional-but-typed lists of strings, valid
  only on a `complete` envelope (Issue #3957) — a `refused`/`failed`/`parked`
  step never got far enough to have read anything meaningful. Recording both,
  rather than only `files_read`, is what lets a report distinguish "reviewed
  everything declared and found nothing" from "skipped every declared file
  and still returned an empty findings array" — the two are otherwise
  indistinguishable from `findings: []` alone.

- A **plan step** (`validate_plan_step`): the one shape the planner writes and
  every lane reads (epic #3927's contract C1). Before this story, the planner
  (`planner.py`) emitted `{step_id, scope, description}` while the lane
  adapters each independently demanded `sweep_id`/`commit_sha`/`files` and
  silently `continue`d past every step that lacked them — zero API calls,
  zero files written, and nothing about it visible from inside either side of
  that contract. `validate_plan_step` is now the single shared definition of
  the shape, so a step can only be malformed once, in one place. Since Issue
  #3958, a step's defining content is a non-empty `hypotheses` array (see
  `validate_hypothesis`) rather than a single free-text `description` —
  `description` is now optional, kept only for backward-readability of a
  human summary a planner may still choose to write.

- A **hypothesis** (`validate_hypothesis`): one structured, planner-originated
  claim a later review pass should investigate, carried in a plan step's
  `hypotheses` array (Issue #3958, epic #3950). Requires `id` (unique within
  the step that proposed it, not globally — two different planners are
  expected to independently mint the same `id` string, e.g. both calling
  their first hypothesis `h1`), `objective` (what security property is being
  investigated), `required_evidence` (what would confirm or refute it), and
  `planner` (which planner proposed it — injected from the sweep's own
  authoritative context by `planner.finalize()`/`finalize_multi_planner()`,
  never trusted from the model, exactly like a step's own `planners` field).

- A **disposition** (`validate_disposition`): the record a finder lane writes
  per hypothesis it was handed, carried in a `complete` step envelope's
  `dispositions` array (Issue #3959, epic #3950). Requires `hypothesis_id`
  (matching the `id` of the hypothesis this disposition resolves),
  `disposition` (one of `investigated`/`candidate_found`/`inconclusive`/
  `not_attempted`), and `summary` (what the lane found, or why it could not
  investigate). A `complete` envelope must carry exactly one disposition per
  hypothesis in the step it resolves — never zero, never two sharing a
  `hypothesis_id` — so a bundle can never complete silently short of the
  hypotheses it was asked to address. `not_attempted` is a legitimate value
  structurally (a lane genuinely could not get to a hypothesis, e.g. a
  budget-driven split — see `harness_runner.py`), but `consolidate.py` treats
  any envelope containing one as an incomplete step, never `complete`, for
  coverage purposes — that policy line lives in `consolidate.py`, not here,
  since this module only validates shape. A `candidate_found` finding
  references the hypothesis it resulted from via `hypothesis_id`, now a
  `REQUIRED_FINDING_FIELDS` entry on every finding, not only ones carrying a
  `candidate_found` disposition.

Also provides `safe_log_event`/`log_event`: this module and its siblings
(resume.py, basedir.py) log diagnostic text that can carry model-generated or
otherwise tainted content (a finding's `title`/`evidence`, an error message
echoing caller input). `json.dumps` escapes embedded newlines and control
characters inside string values, so routing every log line through
`safe_log_event` guarantees a forged payload stays inside its field rather
than rendering as a second, spoofed log record.
