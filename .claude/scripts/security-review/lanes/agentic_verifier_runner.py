"""The real `run` callable for the agentic verifier: one `opencode` process per
turn, IN-CONTAINER, against an open model with tools controlled per phase.

WHY OPENCODE AND NOT THE OTHER THREE HARNESSES. Verification must run on an open
model (closed models' safeguards limit what they will engage with on
vulnerability work), which rules out `claude` and `codex`. That leaves `ollama`
and `opencode`, and `ollama run` is a plain stdin/stdout completion with NO TOOL
LOOP -- it cannot open a file, which is the entire capability this stage needs.
OpenCode has the loop and takes any OpenAI-compatible provider.

WHY THIS SPAWNS A PROCESS AND NOT A CONTAINER. An earlier revision of this file
ran `docker run --network host` per turn, reaching the HOST's ollama daemon.
That worked, and it was wrong: `--network host` puts the one container that
reads source outside the default-deny egress and DNS allowlist that
`launch-investigator` gives every other lane. This module is now a LANE
ENTRYPOINT's helper -- it runs INSIDE one investigator container dispatched with
`--harness ollama`, whose entrypoint has already started an in-container `ollama
serve` (investigator-entrypoint.sh, Issue #3976) behind that firewall. OpenCode
talks to that daemon on localhost, and the daemon's mounted `ollama signin`
keypair does the Cloud auth.

So the credential story is unchanged from the finder lanes, and strictly better
than the host-docker shape it replaces: no OpenCode login, no Zen account, no
API key, no token mounted anywhere near the model -- and the egress policy is
the container's, not the host's.

CONCURRENCY. Several of these run at once inside the one container; measured at
1/2/4/8 workers with no rate limiting and no lost answers. Each worker MUST get
its own `XDG_DATA_HOME`, because `--continue` means "the last session in THIS
store" -- a shared store would have workers continuing each other's
investigations and answering the wrong question. Verified directly: two
concurrent sessions in one container under different XDG_DATA_HOME values each
recalled their own token and not the other's.

TOOL SURFACE, PER PHASE. OpenCode has no `--disallowedTools` flag; permissions
are an `opencode.json` `permission` block (the mechanism `opencode_lane.py`
documents). Two configs are written and which one is used IS the phase:

  investigate    read/grep/glob/list ALLOW; everything else DENY
  forced answer  EVERY permission DENY -- answer from what you already read

`deny` short-circuits without prompting, which matters in a container with no
TTY: an unreviewed `"ask"` default would hang the process rather than fail.
`bash` is denied in BOTH phases -- it is the one permission that would turn a
read-only review into arbitrary execution against the snapshot.
