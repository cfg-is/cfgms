"""Coverage tests for the Ollama Cloud harness finder lane (Issue #3976,
epic #3975).

Most tests drive `run_lane` through the `call_harness_fn` injection seam,
matching the other three lanes' own precedent -- a stub simply writes
whatever `raw_body` it is given to the output path and reports
`(exit_code, rate_limited)`, exactly as `call_ollama_harness` would once it
has already extracted a JSON object from stdout.

The two tests that matter most for this lane specifically --
`test_exit_zero_unauthenticated_response_is_failed_not_complete` and
`test_prose_surrounded_findings_object_is_extracted_and_completes` -- do NOT
use that injection seam. They spawn a real stub `ollama` binary on `PATH`
and call the real `call_ollama_harness`, because the behavior under test is
`call_ollama_harness`'s own stdout-extraction and synthetic-exit-code logic;
a fake `call_harness_fn` would have to reimplement that logic in the test
itself, which would prove nothing about the actual code path.
