"""Shared harness lane-runner library for the security review harness (Issue
#3931, epic #3927's contracts C4 and the refusal-retry-once policy, finding
9/10).

Every future per-harness lane runner (`claude_lane.py`, `codex_lane.py`,
`opencode_lane.py` -- STORY-5b/7/8, out of scope here) calls into this module
for two things, built on STORY-1's (#3928) `terminal_state.classify()`:

## C4 -- one shared prompt, one shared output-schema description

`SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `OUTPUT_SCHEMA_DESCRIPTION` are each defined exactly once,
here, and nowhere else. This is the sole surviving definition once STORY-5b
deletes the three REST lanes (`anthropic.py:126`, `openai.py:118`,
`ollama.py:139`) that each carried their own, differently-worded prompt --
finding 10's "the premise is that different *models* find different bugs;
with different prompts, any divergence is confounded by prompt variance and
the union stops being evidence about the models." A per-harness deviation
(e.g. how a given harness is told where to write its output file) is a
concern for that harness's own runner script, layered around these two
constants, never a second copy of them.

## Review methodology: compact core and per-step anchors (Issue #3981)

`docs/security-review/methodology.md` is the single copy of the review
methodology every lane is held to -- threat model, the closed CWE shortlist
plus its `other:` escape, attacker tiers, the four severity definitions, and
worked CFGMS examples ("anchors") calibrating each level. This module loads
it once at import and is the only place its text becomes prompt content:
`METHODOLOGY_CORE` (always inlined, bounded by `METHODOLOGY_CORE_MAX_CHARS`)
and `METHODOLOGY_ANCHORS` (one per severity level inlined per step, chosen
deterministically by `select_anchors()`). Every lane's `build_prompt` starts
from `shared_preamble(step)` -- the same C4 rule as the two constants above,
extended: no lane assembles or copies any of this text itself.

## Refusal-retry-once bookkeeping (finding 9)

`resume.py` is correct and untouched, per the epic's non-goals -- its own
docstring (`resume.py:19-22`) already assigns this exact concern elsewhere:

    Distinguishing a first-refusal-retry from a second-refusal-surface
    is a lane-side concern (only the lane knows its own fallback-model
    policy) -- this module only reports "still needs work".

Today nothing implements that lane-side concern: `resume.py`'s
`missing_steps` returns every non-`complete`/non-`failed` status as
outstanding forever, so a `refused` step (per the C3 table, "retry once,
then surface") retries without bound. This module is that lane-side concern,
implemented once here instead of never, and instead of being copied into
three future lane runners:

- `refusal_decision(refusal_attempts)` is the pure decision: `RETRY` the
  first time a step classifies `refused` (`refusal_attempts == 0`),
  `SURFACE` every time after.
- The envelope this module builds always carries a `refusal_attempts`
  integer field. `schema.validate_step_envelope()` does not reject unknown
  fields on the envelope itself, so adding this field required no change to
  `schema.py`. (A finding's own fields are a stricter contract: since Issue
  #3983, `cwe` and `line` are required and validated, not tolerated as
  unknown extras -- see `schema.py`'s module docstring.)
- `read_refusal_attempts()` is the only source of that count: it re-reads
  whatever envelope a step's previous attempt actually wrote to disk. This
  module keeps no in-memory record of a step's refusal history between
  calls -- exactly like `resume.py`'s own statelessness ("rescan the lane
  directory, run whatever is missing. There is no separate progress
  database to corrupt") -- so the count survives a process restart, a
  container being torn down and relaunched, or a completely different
  Python process running the retry.
- `apply_refusal_policy()` ties classification to bookkeeping: on the first
  `refused` classification for a step it writes the envelope back with
  `state` still `refused` (so `resume.missing_steps` retries it on the
  lane's *next* invocation, per the four-terminal-state table -- this
  module never retries in-process) and `refusal_attempts` bumped to 1. A
  second consecutive `refused` classification is written `failed` instead
  -- a state `resume.missing_steps` never retries -- carrying
  `refusal_attempts=2`, so "surfaced" actually means surfaced: no third
  retry, ever, and the envelope itself records how it got there. Every
  other classification (`complete`, `parked`, a first-pass `failed`) passes
  through with whatever `refusal_attempts` count was already on disk,
  unchanged.

# methodology every lane is held to. This module loads that document once,
# at import, and is the only place its text becomes a prompt constant -- the
# same C4 single-sourcing contract `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and
# `OUTPUT_SCHEMA_DESCRIPTION` carry: every lane's `build_prompt` calls
# `shared_preamble(step)` and never assembles its own copy.
#
# Delivery is split so the cost stays bounded at ~250 steps per lane:
#   - `METHODOLOGY_CORE` (the text between the `methodology-core` markers) is
#     inlined into every step prompt and must stay at or under
#     `METHODOLOGY_CORE_MAX_CHARS`. The loader refuses a larger core.
#   - Anchors are inlined one per severity level per step, chosen by
#     `select_anchors()` -- a pure function of the step's own scope, files,
#     description and hypotheses, so the same step always gets the same
#     anchors and two steps about different subsystems get different ones.
#     Each anchor must stay at or under `ANCHOR_MAX_CHARS`.
#
# The loader fails closed: a missing document, a missing or duplicated
# marker, a level with fewer than `MIN_ANCHORS_PER_LEVEL` anchors, or an
# oversized core or anchor raises `MethodologyError` at import, so a lane
# cannot start with the methodology silently dropped from its prompts.

    `sweep_id`/`commit_sha`/`lane`/`step_id`/`plan_hash`/`prompt_version`/
    `harness_identity`, matching every existing lane's own envelope-building
    convention.

    `refusal_attempts` is always present, regardless of `state` -- it is not
    a refusal-only field, so a step's full history (including "this step
    once refused, then went on to complete") stays visible in its final
    envelope rather than being dropped once a retry succeeds.

    `plan_hash`/`prompt_version`/`harness_identity` (Issue #3962) are also
    always present, regardless of `state`, for the same reason: a step that
    refused or failed still ran against a specific frozen plan step, system
    prompt, and harness code, and that record is what makes a sweep readable
    after the fact. Only `plan_hash` drives the re-run decision (Issue #4136);
    `prompt_version` and `harness_identity` are recorded for provenance and
    read back through `resume.provenance_by_step()`, never compared against a
    current value. All three are written for the non-`complete` states too,
    which `resume.missing_steps` already always retries.
    Sourced from `context` rather than being separate parameters -- like
    `sweep_id`/`commit_sha`/`lane`/`step_id`, they are identity the caller
    already owns for this step, never invented here.

    `files_intended`/`files_read` (Issue #3957) and `dispositions` (Issue
    #3959) are attached only when `state == COMPLETE`, matching `findings`'s
    own conditional -- a `refused`/`failed`/`parked` step never got far
    enough to have read anything meaningful or to have addressed any
    hypothesis, so the fields are omitted rather than written as an empty
    list that could be misread as "declared and read nothing" or "addressed
    zero hypotheses". Each defaults to an empty list when the caller
    completed a step that declared (or read) no files, or resolved no
    hypotheses, at all -- distinct from the fields being absent. A caller
    completing a step is expected to have already synthesized a
    `not_attempted` disposition for every hypothesis its harness's raw
    output did not address (see each lane's `run_lane`) -- this function
    does not itself guarantee full coverage of a step's hypotheses; that
    guarantee lives in the caller and is independently checked by
    `write_envelope` below via `schema.validate_step_envelope`.

    `dispositions` is passed through `dedupe_dispositions()` before being
    attached, so no caller can build an envelope carrying two entries for one
    `hypothesis_id` -- see that function for why a duplicate is a plan-level
    defect that must not be able to reach `write_envelope`.

    `scans` (Issue #3982) is the per-check scanner summary from
    `scan_summary()` and is attached regardless of `state`, like
    `refusal_attempts`: which tools ran over which scope, whether each
    produced output, failed, timed out or was truncated, is coverage
    information a reader needs for a failed step as much as a complete one.
    Omitted only when the caller passed `None` (a lane predating scans).

    `harness_output_tail` (Issue #4008) is the bounded, control-character-free
    tail of the harness subprocess's own combined stdout+stderr -- see
    `sanitize_harness_output_tail()` -- attached only on a non-`complete`
    envelope, and only when non-empty. Before this, a failed step's envelope
    carried only `stop_reason_raw: "harness_exit_1"`: no auth failure, no
    "unrecognised model id", no crash text, nothing an operator could read
    without re-running the harness call by hand. A `complete` step never
    carries this field at all, matching `findings`'s own conditional --
    whatever the harness printed on a successful run is not a diagnostic
    worth keeping.

# they had time for. Four of the run's failures were this number.
#
# Sized for a finder that may generate at a few tokens per second -- a local
# model on the operator's own hardware, which is where this roster is heading.
# A step generating ~5,000 output tokens at 10 tok/s is ~500s of generation
# alone, before prompt evaluation; 600s was inside the noise of that, 3600s
# leaves real headroom.
#
# BOUNDED, NOT REMOVED. The dispatcher blocks on `docker wait` for each lane,
# so a lane with no timeout at all does not fail loudly -- it hangs the sweep
# with no diagnostic, which is the opposite of this harness's posture

# - every declared path confined to the snapshot by the same syntactic +
#   realpath check `claude_lane.read_step_files` applies to file reads, so an
#   allowlisted `rg` can never be pointed at the credential mount; and, for
#   Go, the WHOLE module tree a package scan implicitly opens (sibling files,
#   imported packages, go.mod, vendor/) must be symlink-free and free of
#   filesystem `replace` directives, or the scope is not scanned at all;
# - one fixed, network-disabled environment (`scan_tool_env`): GOPROXY=off,
#   GOTOOLCHAIN=local, SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS=off, HOME under scratch;
# - per-check timeout and output cap, per-step check-count cap, per-step
#   prompt budget in BYTES -- a scanner printing 50 MB is a denial of service
#   against the sweep inside a 2 GB container;
# - stdout (structured output) and stderr (diagnostics) captured separately,
#   and each tool's real output format parsed for analysis failures, so a
#   compile error or a missing module is a recorded `partial`/`failed` result,
#   never "findings";
# - results cached under `<out_dir>/.scan-cache/` keyed by (commit, tool,
#   tool version, rule-set version, the scanned scope, argv) so the same
#   package is not rescanned for every hypothesis (Decision 2);
# - every non-`ok` outcome -- unsupported language, rejected path, unscannable
#   module tree, missing tool, non-zero exit, analysis error, timeout,

# The shared finder lane (Issue #4072)
#
# `run_lane` below was four near-identical copies, one per harness: 318 lines
# each, 86-95% the same, and every helper it calls byte-identical across all
# four once docstrings were stripped. Issue #4069 built four behaviours in one
# lane and then ported them -- twelve hand-edits across three files, one of
# which was wrong (the hypothesis-id check reached `validate_finding` but not
# `terminal_state.classify`, so the repair round silently never fired until a
# test caught it). That is the failure mode duplication produces, and it recurs
# on every change.
#
# What actually differs between harnesses is small and enumerable, and it is
# exactly what `LaneSpec` carries:
#
#   - the argv and capture mode, already isolated in each lane's own
#     `call_<harness>_harness`
#   - one sentence in `build_prompt`: write to a file path (claude, opencode)
#     or print to stdout (codex, ollama)
#   - the harness name inside the per-step scratch filenames
#   - a lane-fatal condition: claude and codex recognise a model id their CLI
#     rejects, ollama recognises a mounted-but-unusable credential, opencode
#     has none
#
# Everything else -- step iteration, the per-step guard, the budget split, the
# repair round and its convergence rule, diagnostics, envelope assembly, resume
# integration -- lives here once.
