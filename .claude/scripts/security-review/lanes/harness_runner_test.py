"""Coverage tests for lanes/harness_runner.py: the shared lane-runner library
(Issue #3931, epic #3927's C4 and refusal-retry-once policy).

Hand-rolled (no unittest, no third-party test runner, no mocks), matching the
`terminal_state_test.py` / `resume_test.py` convention: stdlib only, exit 0
on all-pass, non-zero otherwise, auto-discovered by `scripts/test-scripts.sh`.

Every envelope-round-trip case is exercised against real files written to a
real temp directory -- never a mocked filesystem -- because the whole point
of `read_refusal_attempts()` is that it works from what a prior process
actually wrote to disk, not from any in-memory value.
