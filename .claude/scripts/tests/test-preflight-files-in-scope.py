"""
Tests: `## Files In Scope` path extraction in po-cycle-preflight.py.

`files_parsed` gates real behaviour — today the dispatcher's file-conflict hold,
next a coverage check — so both error directions cost something. Two defects were
measured in the field before this suite existed:

  1. UNDER-extraction. A path written with the line it refers to
     (`ci.yml:208`, or a `:208-214` range) matched neither PATH regex, because
     both end at the extension. The story then parsed as declaring no files at
     all, which reads downstream as `no files parsed from Files In Scope` and
     holds the story instead of dispatching it.

  2. OVER-extraction. A sentence naming a path in order to EXCLUDE it
     ("Do NOT touch features/.../server.go — owned by #2839") parsed as an
     in-scope declaration, and the dispatcher held the story on a conflict the
     story had explicitly disclaimed.

Both are locked in below, alongside the forms that already worked, so the fix
cannot regress them. The loose body-wide scan (`all_paths_in_body`) is
deliberately NOT tightened — it exists as a permissive diagnostic — and a test
here pins that difference so the two are not "unified" later.

  3. OVER-extraction, structural variant (Issue #3683). A list item's
     commentary tail, or a wrapped continuation line belonging to that item,
     named a second file in passing — "`ChangeTimelineCard.tsx` — new file...
     picked up by `EvidenceCanvas.tsx`'s glob... no edit to that file needed" —
     and the second file parsed as declared anyway, because extraction ran
     per physical line with no notion of "this line continues the item above
     it." Measured on stories #3611 and #3612, which shared no real file but
     were held against each other on a fabricated `EvidenceCanvas.tsx`
     conflict. `TestExactRepro3611And3612`, `TestMultiPathSubject` and
     `TestScopeCorpusDifferential` below cover the fix; see the
     `extract_scope_paths` docstring for the structural rule.
